## Project description:

Website to clone:
[https://circle-agency-35d27e.webflow.io/]

### You’ll be building a website for a fictional web design company. This includes a few pages:
* A "Home" page,
* A “Project” page,
* A "Contact" page with a form.

### Some of the challenges you’ll have to complete will be the following:
* Adding navigation between the pages.
* Making all the fields in the contact form required before being able to submit it.


### Technical Requirements:
* Your website should be rendered in a browser.
* Include separate HTML / CSS / JavaScript files.
* Have a repo on GitHub.
* Have at least 1 commit per day that you worked on it.
* Be deployed online using Vercel so that anybody can access it.
* Stick with KISS (Keep It Simple Stupid) and DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself) principles.
In summary, for this project, you’ll have to recreate a pre-existing design using your HTML & CSS skills. You’ll also have to create a few interactions with the DOM, using what you’ve learned about JavaScript so far.


### Deliverables:
* The URL of the GitHub repository for your project.
* The URL of the live website on the Internet.
* The URL of the slides for your project presentation.
* You must present your project during Mid-term final presentations.


### Project assets:
For this project, you’ll have access to the following assets:
A Figma design that you will have to turn into a live, responsive website. This design also includes a few specifications regarding fonts and colors
A folder with all the images you will need for this project.
